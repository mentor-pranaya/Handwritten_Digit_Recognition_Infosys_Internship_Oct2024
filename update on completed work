->Completed visualisation and normalization

->Completed preprocessing. And the preprocessing steps include
1.Loading the MNIST Dataset:(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
2.Normalization: X_train = X_train.astype('float32') / 255.0
               X_test = X_test.astype('float32') / 255.0
3.Reshaping (Flattening): 
model = Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),  # Flatten 28x28 images to a 1D vector
])
4.One-Hot Encoding:
y_train = to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test, 10)
5.Validation Split (during model training):model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
